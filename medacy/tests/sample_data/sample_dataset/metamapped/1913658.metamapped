Vinorelbine-containing Implants\nThe PLA 37.5 GA 25 copolymer (M, 120,000) was dissolved at room temperature in a mixed solvent composed of chloroform and n-hexane (80:20, v/v).\nWhen the medium was homogeneous, Vinorelbine ditartrate (Pierre Fabre, Madicament, Boulogne, France) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred   vigorously for 30 min.\nHexane was then added dropwise to the suspension until the copolymer-Vinorelbine combination was completely precipitated.\nThe pasty mass thus obtained was kneaded in order to eliminate most of the entrapped solvent.\nResidual solvent was finally evaporated in a vacuum drier for one night at 50\u00b0C. \nThe resulting solid matrix was extruded through a 1.2-mm heated die (70-80\u00b0C) in order to make cylindrical rods.\nThe polymer-drug combination never remained more than 1 or 2 min in the heated apparatus.\nRods were allowed to cool to room temperature, and implants (designated as type E) were cut from the rods according to the desired drug dose.\nThey were finally stored in a light-protected sterilized dessicator in order to avoid any moisture.\nAll manipulations and preparations were done under sterile conditions.\nIn preliminary studies, cylindrical rods were handmade (since the heated die was not yet available).\nThese devices were designated as type H implants.\n"]}, "SemTypes": {"@Count": "1",
